      <p>From the day that I first knew you,
Your heart was pure and kind.
Your smile was sweet and innocent,
Your wit was well refined.

The sparkle in your eyes was keen,
Your friendship fast and real.
Soft words were your virtue,
And humor your appeal. 


As years rolled on, our paths were split,
Our roads went separate ways.
We each pursued our interests,
That occupied our days.

You listened with attentive care, 
And reassured my mind.
That loving hearts are still alive,
With purpose and design.

Deep inside I've locked way,
Emotions yet untold.
As time goes on, and bonds grow strong,
They will all unfold. 

So thank you, friend, for taking time,
To demonstrate your love.
It's yet another blessing that, 
I'm undeserving of.</p>

    <h> Lucky Me. <h/>
        <p> I am very lucky to know someone as loyal and honest as you. Life usually brings you unpleasant surprises and events, but ever since you have ame into mine I feel there is a new lighthouse to guide me in my moments of indecision and doubt.
You are special in a natural way, but apart from that, I can also see you the interest and effort you put into making yourself available to others.
I can see your interest in making the lives of your friends lighter, happier, more comfortable and prosperous!
Now that everything seems confused, now that people seem to be losing their faith in a better future, it is good to know there is someone special like you close by. It is really great to know there is someone you can turn to.
Itâ€™s great to know that you have such a friend. You are very special.
